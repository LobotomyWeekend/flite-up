NOTES on TEST DATA

To manually generate lots of test data in the same structure as
the full json file will take AGEESSSS. I need to strip it back so it
only has the really important data, saved in the same structure.

    > OridinId
    > DestinationId
    > Price
    > DepartureDate (OutboundLeg + InboundLeg)

How many for useful results?

    > 2 Origins
    > 4 Destinations
        > 2 return flights during period

    2 origins * 4 destinations * (2*2) individual flights 
        = 32 ENTRIES
    
Each origin should have 4 Routes, 8 Quotes, 

We will therefore have 2 files, one is a response for Glasgow, 
another for Lisbon.
