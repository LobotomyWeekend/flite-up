ALGORITHM METHOD

To successfully produce an algorithm I need to come up with a 
plan for how it will work.

STEP 1 - Process Request

    > Make "API Request"
    > Load JSON files
    > Remove/Ignore any destinations not common to all

STEP 2 - Compare prices

    > Find relevant combinations of flights (e.g. GLA-CDG + LIS-CDG)
    > Calculate Average price for each combo
    > Calculate standard deviations
    > Generate RESULTS array containing combos:
        > Destination
        > Flight Times (Origin 1 + 2)
            > Tails
            > Overlap Length
        > Flight Prices (Origin 1 + 2)
        > Average Flight Price
        > Standard Deviation Flight Price

STEP 3 - Display Results

    > Sort RESULTS array
    > Display on Map
    > Provide structured list
    > Timeline with comparison
